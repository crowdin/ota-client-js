# Lingui

[Lingui](https://lingui.dev/) is a JavaScript library for internalization (i18n) of JavaScript projects, including React, Vue, Next.js, Node.js, Angular, and others.

## Installation

First, you need to [install and set up](https://lingui.dev/introduction) Lingui for your project.

Then, install the Crowdin OTA Client:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @crowdin/ota-client
```

## Usage

Integrating the Crowdin OTA Client with Lingui is pretty straightforward. You just need to [load](https://lingui.dev/ref/core#i18n) messages received from the OTA client instead of the local files.

```typescript
import { i18n } from "@lingui/core"
import otaClient from "@crowdin/ota-client"

export const locales = {
    en: "English",
    cs: "ÄŒesky",
}

export const defaultLocale = "en"

export async function dynamicActivate(locale: string) {
    const client = new otaClient('<distribution-hash>')
    const messages = await client.getStringsByLocale(locale)

    i18n.load(locale, messages)
    i18n.activate(locale)
}
```

:::tip
Over-The-Air Content Delivery will work out of the box for the [`minimal`](https://lingui.dev/ref/catalog-formats#json) catalog format.

If you are using the [`po`](https://lingui.dev/ref/catalog-formats#po) format, you will need to set up the [Lingui String Exporter](https://store.crowdin.com/lingui-string-exporter) for your Crowdin project.
