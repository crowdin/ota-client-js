# Migration from 1.x to 2.x

Migrating to 2.x is a major update, but should be straightforward and easy. The changes that may affect your integration are described below.

### Node.js Version

The minimum required version of Node.js is **18.x**.

### Axios Dependency Removed

In this release, we've removed the Axios dependency from the Crowdin OTA JS client. This change addresses security concerns and streamlines the client by using the native Fetch API instead.

Axios was only used for a few GET operations that can be handled by the native Node.js `fetch`. In addition, developers were experiencing issues with Axios in modern build environments, making it cumbersome to use.

#### Benefits

- **Smaller Bundle**: Reduces the size of the client for better performance.
- **Improved Security**: Fewer dependencies means less potential vulnerabilities. Now OTA JS client is **zero-dependency** library.
- **Simplified Setup**: No more manual Axios installation or configuration needed.

#### Migration Steps

If you have a custom Axios instance used for the OTA JS client, you can now remove it and uninstall the Axios package if it's not being used elsewhere. Otherwise, no changes are required.
