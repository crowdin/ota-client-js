# Configuration

There is a way to customize the client to your needs. You can pass a configuration object as a second (optional) argument in the constructor.

```typescript
import otaClient, { ClientConfig } from '@crowdin/ota-client';

const config: ClientConfig = {
  httpClient: customHttpClient,
  disableManifestCache: false,
  languageCode: 'uk',
  disableStringsCache: false,
  disableJsonDeepMerge: true
};

const hash = '{distribution_hash}';

const client = new otaClient(hash, config);
```

## Config Options

### `hash`

Distribution Hash. See the [Content Delivery](https://support.crowdin.com/content-delivery/) article for more details.
